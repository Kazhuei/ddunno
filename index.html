Love, I know we don’t always say the deepest things out loud, but I hope you feel them every day.
You calm parts of me I didn’t even know were restless.Being with you feels like how a song settles in your chest when you hear it for the first time and somehow already know the words.

I don’t need big gestures, or what, I just need you. Even your silence feels like home to me. <br><br>– from me, always <br><br><button onclick="closeModal()" class="close-btn">Got it</button> </div>
